# ELEC-2220-Self-Balancing-Robot
The goal of this project will be to develop a two-wheeled self-balancing robot.  This project requires the development of an interface between several devices, including an accelerometer and two servomotors, and the ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller on an STM32F4-Discovery board, with the servomotors controlled using pulse width modulation (PWM).  In order to accomplish this, the high-level programming language, C, will primarily be used to develop the algorithms to take the input from the accelerometer and output the adjustments to the servomotors controlling the two wheels.  Some low-level assembly programming may also be used in conjunction with C.  This project is for my Honors Contract for ELEC 2220, Computer Systems at Auburn University.
